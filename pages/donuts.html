    <div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>240ml of whole milk</li>
            <li>7g of instant yeast</li>
            <li>65g of sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>85g of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>   
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>500g of flour</li>
            <li>Frying oil</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5–10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining sugar, the eggs, butter, vanilla, nutmeg, salt, and 2 cups (about 250g) flour. Beat on low speed for 1 minute. Add remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. If needed, add more flour.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough: you can do it by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5–7 minutes. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.</li>
            <li>Let Dough Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5–2 hours or until double in size.</li>
            <li>Shape Doughnuts: When the dough is ready, remove it from the bowl and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3–3.5-inch doughnut cutter, cut into doughnuts.</li>
            <li>Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Place doughnuts and doughnut holes on each. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes as you heat the oil. Place a cooling rack over another baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a large heavy-duty pot fitted with an oil thermometer. Turn stove on to medium heat. Heat oil to 191°C. Add 2–3 doughnuts at a time and cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove with a metal slotted spatula or metal slotted spoon. Be sure to lower stove’s temperature if oil temperature is rising; you want it to stay at 191°C. Place fried doughnuts onto prepared rack.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
